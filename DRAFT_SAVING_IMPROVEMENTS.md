# Draft Saving Improvements

## Problem Analysis

The original draft saving system had significant limitations:

1. **Limited Auto-Save**: Only saved drafts after completing Step 2 (Practice Information)
2. **Data Loss Risk**: Users could lose work from Steps 3-7 if they left the form
3. **No Manual Save**: No way for users to manually save their progress
4. **Poor User Feedback**: Limited indication of save status

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Auto-Save System

**Auto-save after every step** (starting from Practice Information):
- Drafts are now saved automatically after completing each step
- Users never lose progress when navigating between steps

**Periodic auto-save** (every 30 seconds):
- Automatically saves drafts while users are actively filling out forms
- Only runs when there are unsaved changes and user is past Step 1

### 2. Manual Save Draft Button

**Save Draft button** appears on Steps 2-6:
- Allows users to manually save their progress at any time
- Positioned between Previous and Next buttons
- Styled with blue border to indicate secondary action

### 3. Improved User Feedback

**Enhanced status indicators**:
- Shows "✓ Draft saved" or "✓ Auto-saved" messages
- Displays save timestamp when not actively saving
- Shows "● Unsaved changes" when user has made modifications

**Real-time save status**:
- Tracks when changes are made to any form field
- Updates save status immediately after successful saves
- Shows relative time since last save (e.g., "2 mins ago")

### 4. Data Loss Prevention

**Unsaved changes tracking**:
- Monitors all form inputs for changes
- Tracks visit date, practice info, samples, topics, survey, and credit card data

**Browser exit warning**:
- Shows confirmation dialog if user tries to leave with unsaved changes
- Prevents accidental data loss from browser navigation

### 5. Comprehensive Change Detection

**All form inputs now trigger unsaved state**:
- Date picker changes
- Text input changes
- Sample quantity changes
- Toggle state changes
- Survey responses
- Credit card information
- Other sample text input

## Technical Implementation

### New State Variables
```javascript
const [hasUnsavedChanges, setHasUnsavedChanges] = useState(false);
const [lastSaveTime, setLastSaveTime] = useState(null);
const [autoSaveInterval, setAutoSaveInterval] = useState(null);
```

### Enhanced saveDraft Function
- Accepts `isAutoSave` parameter to differentiate auto vs manual saves
- Updates unsaved changes state after successful saves
- Shows appropriate success/error messages
- Handles errors gracefully without blocking user workflow

### Auto-Save Logic
- 30-second interval for periodic saves
- Only runs when there are unsaved changes
- Automatically cleans up intervals on component unmount
- Prevents multiple intervals from running simultaneously

### Browser Integration
- `beforeunload` event listener warns about unsaved changes
- Integrates with browser's native "leave page" confirmation

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Peace of Mind**: Users know their work is being saved automatically
2. **Control**: Manual save option gives users control over when to save
3. **Transparency**: Clear indicators show save status and timing
4. **Safety**: Multiple layers of protection against data loss

## Benefits

- **Zero Data Loss**: Users can't lose work regardless of when they leave
- **Better UX**: Clear feedback about save status reduces anxiety
- **Flexibility**: Both automatic and manual saving options
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and cleanup
- **Performance**: Efficient change tracking and conditional auto-save

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test auto-save after each step completion
2. Verify 30-second periodic auto-save functionality
3. Test manual "Save Draft" button on all applicable steps
4. Confirm browser exit warning appears with unsaved changes
5. Verify save status indicators update correctly
6. Test error handling when save operations fail
