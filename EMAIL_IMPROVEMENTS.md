# Email Notification Improvements

## Problem Analysis

The original email notifications were missing several important fields from the multistep form:

**Missing Fields:**
1. `drName` - Doctor's name
2. `frontDeskName` - Front desk staff name  
3. `backOfficeAssistantName` - Back office assistant name
4. `officeManagerName` - Office manager name
5. `survey` - Complete survey data with all survey questions

## Implemented Solutions

### Enhanced Email Templates

Both the **new visit** and **update visit** email templates now include:

#### 1. **Complete Staff Information Section**
- Doctor Name
- Front Desk Name  
- Back Office Assistant Name
- Office Manager Name
- Only shows fields that have data (conditional display)

#### 2. **Comprehensive Survey Responses Section**
- Knew about products before visit (Yes/No/Not answered)
- Sold products before (Yes/No/Not answered)
- Interested in AlignerFresh (Yes/No/Not answered)
- Gave IPR Glide sample (Yes/No/Not answered)
- Spoke to doctor (Yes/No/Not answered)

- Quoted prices (Yes/No/Not answered)
- Price details (if provided)
- Ready to order (Yes/No/Not answered)

#### 3. **Improved Email Structure**
- **Practice Information** section
- **Staff Information** section  
- **Samples Provided** section
- **Visit Details** section
- **Survey Responses** section

#### 4. **Better Data Handling**
- Handles null/undefined survey responses gracefully
- Shows "Not answered" for boolean fields that are null
- Only displays optional text fields when they contain data
- Improved fallbacks for empty data

## Technical Implementation

### Survey Data Processing
```javascript
// Boolean fields with null handling
${visitData.survey.knewAboutProducts !== null ? 
  (visitData.survey.knewAboutProducts ? 'Yes' : 'No') : 'Not answered'}

// Optional text fields with conditional display
${visitData.survey.quotedPricesDetails ? 
  `<p><strong>Price details:</strong> ${visitData.survey.quotedPricesDetails}</p>` : ''}
```

### Staff Information Conditional Display
```javascript
// Only show staff fields that have data
${visitData.drName ? `<p><strong>Doctor Name:</strong> ${visitData.drName}</p>` : ''}
${visitData.frontDeskName ? `<p><strong>Front Desk Name:</strong> ${visitData.frontDeskName}</p>` : ''}
```

### Improved Samples Display
```javascript
// Better handling of empty samples
<p><strong>Samples:</strong> ${visitData.samplesProvided.map(sample =>
  typeof sample === 'object' ? `${sample.name}: ${sample.quantity}` : sample
).join(', ') || 'None'}</p>
```
